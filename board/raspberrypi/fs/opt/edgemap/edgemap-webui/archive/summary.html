	EdgeMap is <a href="https://buildroot.org/">buildroot</a> built <i>embedded linux firmware</i> for Raspberry Pi 4, 
	which provides stand alone <a href="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js">web map</a> appliance 
	and Curson on Target (CoT) <a href="https://github.com/tkuester/taky">server.</a>
	 
	<p>
	It can be used to rapidly prototype off the grid mapping application integrations and it's ability
	to render targets from websocket provided data stream makes it interesting test platform for fast rate navigation sources.
	With EdgeMap you can have one SD card which holds Operating System, web server, off the grid map data and CoT server. 
	<p>
	EdgeMap is NOT production ready solution as such, but provides understandable, compact and minimized code base for given task. 
	Main goal has been minimazing dependencies, keeping things simple and wihtout bloated or vendor controlled technologies.
	</p>
	<h2>Resilience</h2>
	<p>EdgeMap is created as an resilience example, where your Operating System image is created from source code which you have
	at hand. Buildroot build can be kept offline and on premises, supporing your mission critical deployment tasks in any situation.
	This same approach can be used with OSM map data creation, where mbtiles are produced 'on prem' as well. This makes it possible
	to have security of supply and resilience for solution to be available in any circumstances.</p>
	<h2>Prototyping</h2>
	You can use EdgeMap for fast prototyping. You can push data to sqlite3 database and write small PHP script to retrieve that as GeoJSON,
	which is then displayed on map (this example is provided on image). Another example included is <i>high rate</i> websocket stream for 
	highly movable target data, where target position is updated 20 Hz (or above) rate.

	<p>Additional two examples are 'Sniper Control' and 'Messaging' panels, which do read websocket data as well for low latency state
	updates.</p>
	<h2>Firmware</h2>
	We call this image 'firmware' and not 'linux distribution', which illustrates best what it's made for: small embedded Linux tailored
	for defined task. As it's purpose built 'firmaware' - you cannot install packages to image directly, you need to compile image with 
	buildroot and deploy it via SD card.
	<p>We believe this approach is effecient and well defined when control and resilience are targeted on mission critical embedded Linux 
	solutions. Given approach leaves all bloated distro specific parts out and creates small fast booting embedded firmware for you
	mission critical integrations.</p>
	<h2>Software</h2>
	As all of software components are freely available, you may of course install EdgeMap on any Linux distribution and make it run big time.
	Or use your laptop with php enabled apache to display small map from locally stored mbtiles. Check our github for more details and download
	this 'one php file' for testing.
